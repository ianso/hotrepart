= Goals =

 * Adapting the code to deploy new partitions on EC2 instances. Currently, the new partition runs on the same host as the existing database.
 * Building a plugin for monitoring software such as [http://www.nagios.org/ Nagios] to automatically trigger repartitioning under extended periods of high load.
 * Adapting the stress tester to run on multiple hosts and collate telemetry on a single console.

= Task list =

 * the new DB should be brought up on a new EC2 instance.
 * conditional on performance, should the current table-based queue replication of writes be replaced with something from e.g. slony?
 * Add PGBouncer installation to the docs, since a production environment would need this.

= Todos =

Detailed todos are listed in hotrepart.todo in the subversion root.
